Expected and observed exclusion limits in the (mgluino, mninoone) plane for the ten-quark model given by the total-jet-mass analysis. Limits are obtained by using the signal region with the best expected sensitivity at each point. The dashed black lines show the expected limits at 95% CL, with the light (yellow) bands indicating the 1&sigma; excursions due to experimental and background-only theory uncertainties. Observed limits are indicated by medium dark (maroon) curves, where the solid contour represents the nominal limit, and the dotted lines are obtained by varying the signal cross-section by the renormalization and factorization scale and PDF uncertainties.
