Diagrams for the benchmark processes considered for this analysis. The solid black lines represent Standard Model particles, the solid red lines represent SUSY partners, the gray shaded circles represent effective vertices that include off-shell propagators (e.g. heavy squarks coupling to a &chi;<sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub> neutralino and a quark), and the blue shaded circles represent effective RPV vertices allowed by the baryon-number-violating &lambda’’ couplings with off-shell propagators (e.g. heavy squarks coupling to two quarks).
