(a) Total-jet-mass in the 4jCR with p<sub>T</sub><sup>3</sup>&gt;100 GeV. The reweighted template (built in the 3jCR, and applied jet-by-jet in the relevant region) is shown in the hatched blue histogram. (b) Total-jet-mass in the 4jCR with p<sub>T</sub><sup>3</sup>&gt;250 GeV. The 4jCR mass distribution is shown in the black filled circles. The total systematic uncertainty due to the smoothing procedure, finite statistics in control regions, and the difference between template prediction and the data observed in the 4jCR is shown in green.
