(a) Total-jet-mass in the 4jVR with p<sub>T</sub><sup>3</sup>&gt;100 GeV. The reweighted template is shown in the hatched blue histogram. (b) Total-jet-mass in the 4jVR with p<sub>T</sub><sup>3</sup>&gt;250 GeV. The 4jVR M<sub>J</sub><sup>&Sigma;</sup> spectra are shown in the open black squares.  The total systematic uncertainty due to the smoothing procedure, finite statistics in control regions, and the difference between template prediction and the data observed in the 4jCR is shown in green.
