The number of observed events in the inclusive &ge;6-jet (a,b,c) and &ge;7-jet (d,e,f) signal regions compared with expectations using the Pythia extrapolations from low jet-multiplicity control regions, as a function of the jet p<sub>T</sub> requirement. The distributions representing the extrapolations across two units in jet multiplicity (red triangles) are used as the final background prediction in each case, while the other extrapolations are treated as cross-checks. Various b-tagging requirements are shown: &ge;0 b-tagged jets required (a,d), &ge;1 b-tagged jet (b,e), and &ge;2 b-tagged jets (c,f). In the ratio plots the green shaded regions represent the background systematic uncertainties.
