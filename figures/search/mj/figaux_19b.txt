(a) Expected optimal SR for each point in the (mgluino, mninoone) plane. 1 corresponds to SR100, and 2 corresponds to SR250. (b) Ratio of expected upper-limit cross-section exclusions, between SR100 and SR250. Values &gt;1 indicate a stronger limit from SR250; values &lt;1 indicate a stronger limit from SR100. As expected, SR250 is stronger at higher mgluino, with a 60% stronger limit at mgluino = 1400 GeV. SR100 is able to increase the strength of the limits at low mgluino by 40-50%.
