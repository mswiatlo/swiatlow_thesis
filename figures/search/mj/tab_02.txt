Table showing the predicted in the SM and observed number of events in SR1 as well as three representative signal scenarios. Acceptances (including efficiency) of the various signals are listed in parentheses. The background uncertainties are displayed as statistical + systematic; the signal uncertainties are displayed as statistical + systematic + theoretical.
