Table showing model-independent upper limits in various signal regions. Columns two and three show the expected and observed numbers of events. The uncertainties on the expected yields represent systematic and statistical uncertainties. Column four shows the probabilities, represented by the p<sub>0</sub> values, that the observed numbers of events are compatible with the background-only hypothesis (the p<sub>0</sub> values are obtained with pseudo-experiments). Columns five and six show respectively the expected and observed 95% CL upper limit on non-SM events (N<sub>non-SM</sub>), and columns seven and eight show respectively the 95% CL upper limit on the visible signal cross-section (&sigma;<sub>vis</sub> = &sigma;<sub>prod</sub> &times; A &times; &epsilon;). In the case where N<sub>expected</sub> exceeds N<sub>observed</sub> the p<sub>0</sub> is set to &ge; 0.5.
