Comparisons of the deviation between data and expectations in the control and signal regions without b-tagging requirements are shown, as a function of the jet p<sub>T</sub> requirement. The solid black line shows the relative difference between the observed data and the predicted background. The coarsely dashed blue distribution shows the relative systematic uncertainty on the background estimation. The finely dashed red distribution shows the total uncertainty on the comparison between background and data, including the background systematic uncertainty and all sources of statistical uncertainty from the data and simulation. The figures show (a) Exactly 5 jets, &geq;0 b-tagged jets, (b) &geq;6 jets, &geq;0 b-tagged jets, (c) &geq;7 jets, &geq;0 b-tagged jets.
