Signal region data event (Run: tt206971, Event: tt21140400) with M<sub>J</sub><sup>&Sigma;</sup> =963 GeV and |&Delta; &eta;|=0.33. The jets displayed are reconstructed using the anti-k<sub>t</sub> algorithm with either R=0.4 or R=1.0, as indicated in the legend. In cases where kt subjets are shown, a nominal radius of R=0.3 is used with the inclusive kt algorithm. Both jets and subjets are colored according to their p<sub>T</sub>. In some cases, the subjets are shaded according to their subjet p<sub>T</sub> fraction, defined as the ratio of the p<sub>T</sub> of the subjet to the p<sub>T</sub> of the parent jet. The dots shown represent the topological clusters that are used as input to the jet finding.
