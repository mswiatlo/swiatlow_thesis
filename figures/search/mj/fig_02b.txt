The number of observed events in the 5-jet bin is compared to the background expectation that is determined by using Pythia to extrapolate the number of events in data from the low jet-multiplicity control regions. The contents of the bins represent the number of events with 5-jets passing a given jet p<sub>T</sub> requirement. These bins are inclusive in jet p<sub>T</sub>. Results with various b-tagging requirements are shown: a) &ge; 0 b-tagged jets required, b) &ge; 1 b-tagged jets required, c) &ge; 2 b-tagged jets required.
