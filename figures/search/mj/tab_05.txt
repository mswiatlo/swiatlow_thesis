Optimization results for the six-quark model under a variety of gluino mass hypotheses when the RPV vertex has various branching ratio combinations corresponding to respective RPV terms given by lampp<sub>ijk</sub> being nonzero. The optimized signal region selection requirements are shown along with the resulting background and signal expectations and the number of observed data events. The nominal signal acceptance (including efficiency) is also shown for each result. Quoted errors represent both the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature.
