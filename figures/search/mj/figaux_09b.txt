Comparisons of the deviation between data and expectations in the 5-jet control regions when b-tagging requirements are included: (a) &geq;1 b-tagged jet, (b) &geq;2 b-tagged jets. The solid black line shows the relative difference between the observed data and the predicted background. The blue distribution shows the relative systematic uncertainty on the background estimation calibrated from these control regions. The red distribution shows the total uncertainty on the comparison between background and data, including the background systematic uncertainty and all sources of statistical uncertainty from the data and simulation.
