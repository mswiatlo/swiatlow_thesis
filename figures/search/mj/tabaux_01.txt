Optimization results for the ten-quark model under a variety of mass hypotheses when all lampp couplings are nonzero and equal but no b-tagging requirements are allowed to enter the optimization procedure. The optimized signal region selection requirements are shown along with the resulting background and signal expectations and the number of observed data events. The nominal signal acceptance (including efficiency) is also shown for each result. Quoted errors represent both statistical and systematic uncertainty.
