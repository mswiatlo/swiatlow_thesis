Comparison between signal and background for (a) the scalar sum of the masses of the four leading large-R jets M<sub>J</sub><sup>&Sigma;</sup> and (b) the difference in pseudorapidity between the two leading largeR jets |&Delta; &eta;|. Several typical signal points are shown, as well as the distributions obtained from the data. All distributions are normalized to the same area. The selection requires four or more jets, similar to the 4j regions but inclusive in |&Delta; &eta;|.
