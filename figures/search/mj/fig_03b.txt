The data are compared with the expected background shapes in the exclusive 6- and 7-jet bins before b-tagging. The contents of the bins represent the number of events with the given number of jets passing a given jet p<sub>T</sub> requirement. The bins with less than 10% expected signal contamination are control regions that are considered when assigning systematic uncertainties to the background yield. These control regions are the bins to the left of the vertical red lines in the plots. (a) shows the 6-jet region, and (b) shows the 7-jet region with average jet pseudorapidity &lang;|&eta;|&rang; > 1.0.
