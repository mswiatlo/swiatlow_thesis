Expected and observed exclusion limits in the (mgluino, mninoone) plane for the ten-quark model given by the jet-counting analysis. (a) shows the results when the branching ratios for the RPV decay are considered inclusively, without any b-tagging requirements applied. This figure is analogous to figrefresults:merged. (b) shows the exclusion results when b-tagging requirements are allowed to enter into the optimization procedure, improving limits significantly.
