Total-jet-mass in the 4jSR (a) using p<sub>T</sub><sup>3</sup>&gt;100 GeV (SR100) and (b) using p<sub>T</sub><sup>3</sup>&gt;250 GeV (SR250). For the SR100 selection, the reweighted template (built in the 3jCR, and reweighted jet-by-jet in the 4jCR) is shown in the hatched blue histogram.   The total systematic uncertainty due to the smoothing procedure, finite statistics in control regions, and the difference between template prediction and the data observed in the 4jCR is shown in green.
