(a) Signal region data event (Run: tt206971, Event: tt21140400) with M<sub>J</sub><sup>&Sigma;</sup> =963 GeV and |&Delta; &eta;|=0.33. (b) Signal region data event (Run: tt214553, Event: tt215620967) with M<sub>J</sub><sup>&Sigma;</sup> =937 GeV and |&Delta; &eta;|=0.04. The jets shown in the displays represent anti-k<sub>t</sub> jets with a  nominal radius of R=0.4. The length of the symbols is proportional to the jet transverse energy. Tracks in the inner detector are colored according to their transverse momentum.
