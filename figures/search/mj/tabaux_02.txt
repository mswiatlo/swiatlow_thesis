Table showing a breakdown of the systematics for SR1. The first three entries refer to uncertainties on the background, and the latter four refer to uncertainties on the signal. The variance is the propagated statistical uncertainty from the 3jCR. The bias is the size of the correction due to the over-smoothing of the Gaussian kernel. The 4jCR Difference is the observed signficant difference between the data prediction in the 4jCR. The JMS is the jet mass scale uncertainty, and the JES is the jet energy scale uncertainty. The JMR is the jet mass resolution uncertainty, and the JER is the jet energy resolution uncertainty.
