The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is the enormously successful set of theories, developed mostly in the 1960s-1970s, which are the best known description of fundamental physics. The SM describes all known matter and all known interactions (besides gravity) with startling precision: some observables, such as the value of the electromagnetic coupling constant, $\alpha$, have even been measured to within 1 part in $10^{10}$ of their predicted value \editnote{cite}. Moreover, many precision analyses performed in a huge variety of final states at the LHC, summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:sm:summary}, all show strong agreement with the prediction: the SM has been extraordinarily successful at describing the high-energy physics frontier.

The theory consists of two main parts: the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory of electroweak interactions, which describes the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, and Quantum Chromodynamics, which describes the strong nuclear force. Together these form the symmetry group of the Standard Model, $SU(3)_C \otimes SU(2)_W \otimes U(1)_Y$. With the discovery of the Higgs Boson, the mechanism of symmetry breaking in the electroweak sector has been elucidated, and all the particles predicted by the model have been identified. While the SM is complete in this sense, there are still many questions which it does not address, and some of these will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:susy} and \ref{chapter:search}. At the same time, some predictions of the SM-- the decay channels of the Higgs Boson, or the details of parton showering in QCD-- are still not fully understood, and one new measurement of such SM phenomena is presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter:color}.

The following sections give an overview of the SM and outline some of its most powerful successes. The approach will be very cursory, aiming to give a broad overview of the SM Lagrangian and how various parts of it function; detailed references can be found in \cite{schwartz,2006physics11219P}. \editnote{Citations on main historial papers?}



\section{The Electroweak Force and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking}

\editnote{Cite Schwartz}

To start, we characterize the electroweak force, i.e. the $SU(2)_W \otimes U(1)_Y$ part of the SM. Note that the $U(1)_Y$ is the gauge group of \textit{hypercharge}, not the low-energy $U(1)$ associated with electromagnetism. Similarly, the particles associated with the $SU(2)_W$ are not the vector bosons $W$ and $Z$: instead, linear combinations of all these fields form the familiar mass eigenstates. 

The Lagrangian of the electroweak sector (writing down all renormalizable and gauge-invariant terms), is:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sm:electroweak_l}
\mL = - \frac{1}{4} (W_{\mu\nu}^a)^2 - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu\nu}^2 + (D_\mu H)^\dagger (D_\mu H) + m^2 H^\dagger H - \lambda(H^\dagger H)^2,
\end{equation}
%,
where $W_\mu^a$ are the $SU(2)$ gauge bosons, $B_\mu$ is the hypercharge gauge boson (and $B_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu$), and $H$ is a complex doublet with hypercharge $1/2$, called the Higgs multiplet. The covariant derivative $D_\mu$ is defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
D_\mu H = \partial_\mu H - i g W_\mu^a \tau^a H - \frac{1}{2} i g' B_\mu H,
\end{equation}
%
with $g$ and $g'$ as the $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ coupling constants, and $\tau^a$ as the standard $SU(2)$ generator. The last part of the Lagrangian, $V(H) = -m^2 |H|^2 +\lambda |H|^4$, is the \textit{Higgs potential}. A potential of this form has a minimum at $|\langle H \rangle| = \sqrt{\frac{2 m^2}{\lambda}}$, which induces a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the scalar field. This vev means that the ground state spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the potential. Written out in terms of the multiplet, and taken as real and in one direction only without loss of generality, this vev can be written as:
%
\begin{equation}
H = \exp \left( 2i \frac{\pi^a \tau^a}{v} \right) \colvec{2}{0}{\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}+ \frac{h}{\sqrt{2}}}
\end{equation}
%
where $v = m / \sqrt{\lambda}$, and $h$ is a real scalar field. A simple gauage choice allows us to set $\pi = 0$, simplifying the phase of the vev. Plugging this into the covariant derivative term, and ignoring $h$ terms for now, we have:
%
\begin{equation}
|D_\mu H|^2 = g^2 \frac{v^2}{8} \left[ (W_\mu^1)^2 + (W_\mu^2)^2 + \left( \frac{g'}{g} B_\mu - W_\mu^3 \right) \right]
\end{equation}
%
These are the mass terms of the three massive gauge bosons (each proportional to $\frac{g^2 v^2}{8}$). To simplify these masses, we introduce $\tan(\theta_w) = \frac{g'}{g}$, which allows us to write:
%
\begin{align}
Z_\mu &\equiv \cos \theta_w W_\mu^3 - \sin \theta_w B_\mu\\
A_\mu &\equiv \sin \theta_w W_\mu^3 + \cos \theta_w B_\mu
\end{align}
%
and introduce a change of linear basis for the $W^{1,2}$ terms as $W_\mu^{\pm} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (W_\mu^1 \mp i W_\mu^2)^2$. Plugging this into the original mass terms, we get:
%
\begin{align}
m_A &= 0\\
m_W &= \frac{v}{2} g\\
m_Z &= \frac{v}{2} \sqrt{g^2 +g'^2} = \frac{m_W}{\cos \theta_w}
\end{align}
%
These are the mass terms of the familiar photon, $W$, and $Z$ bosons. The original Lagrangian in Equation~\ref{eqn:sm:electroweak_l} contained only massless bosons: in fact, writing down masses directly would break the $SU(2)$ invariance of the Lagrangian. Instead, the breaking of the symmetry of the Higgs potential with the vev has given masses to the various linear combinations of the initially massless bosons. These mass terms originate as three out of the four original degrees of freedom of the complex Higgs doublet. \editnote{More on this, goldstone bosons?}  

Using these transformations on the rest of the original Lagrangian allows for the derivation of the kinetic terms of each boson, as well as the interactions (which are considerably more complicated now that we have broken the original electroweak symmetry). Returning now to the previously ignored $h$ term, we can collect its kinetic terms and couplings to get:
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Higgs} = - \frac{1}{2} h \left(\square + \frac{2\lambda}{v^2}\right) h + \mathrm{interactions}.
\end{equation}
%
These are the kinetic and (tree-level) mass terms of a new scalar particle, the Goldstone boson associated with the vev spontaneously breaking the electroweak symmetry, and the last degree of freedom of the original complex Higgs multiplet. This Higgs boson, discovered by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on July 4, 2012, was the ``last piece'' of the Standard Model, and its discovery confirmed one of the final open questions of the SM. That is not to say that there are no remaining puzzles, and indeed, Section~\ref{chapter:susy:problems} will address some that are directly related to the Higgs.

\section{Quantum Chromodynamics and Strong Interactions}

%define QCD lagrangian, discuss renormalization at high level, sign of beta function leading to asymptotic freedom
Next, we characterize the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) force, which is governed by the symmetry group $SU(3)_C$. The QCD Lagrangian, defined by writing down all renormalizable and gauage invariant terms, is defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
\mL_{\mathrm{QCD}} = \sum_f i \bar{\psi_f} D_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi_f - \frac{1}{4} G_{\mu\nu}^a G_{a}^{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
%
where the covariant derivative is defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
D_\mu = \partial_\mu - i g_s G_\mu^a T^a
\end{equation}
%
The sum is over the $f$ families of the quarks, $\psi_f$, which will be described in more detail in Section~\ref{chapter:sm:matter}; $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant, $G_\mu^a$ are gluon fields, and $T^a$ are the generators of the $SU(3)$ group. $G_{\mu\nu}^a$, like the $B_{\mu\nu}$ terms from the electroweak interaction, is a field strength, defined as:
%
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu}^a \equiv \partial_\mu G_\nu^a - g_s f^{abc}G_\mu^b G_\nu^c
\end{equation}
%
where $f^{abc}$ are the $SU(3)$ structure constants. The first term in the Lagrangian clearly provides the kinetic term for the quarks, and their interactions with gluons; the second term, when expanded, provides the kinetic term for gluons and their self-interactions, which include terms with both 3-gluon vertices and 4-gluon vertices. Note the Lagrangian has been written with the color index suppressed: the $\psi$ are in reality column vectors over $\alpha$, the color index, and the $G$ term is a matrix, with two color indices $\alpha, \beta$. This color charge of quarks and gluons, typically identified as red, blue, and green, gives rise to a number of interesting phenomena. %For example, the three quarks are essentially independent particles, explaining why decays of particles such as the $Z$-boson are more prevalent to quarks (as decays occur equally to all types, and the additional color factor means there are more types of quarks).

\subsection{Asymptotic Freedom}
\label{chapter:sm:qcd:freedom}
The quantization of the QCD Lagrangian (or really, any field theory) allows for so-called \textit{loop terms}, such as Figure~\ref{fig:sm:loop}, to appear in calculations. These loops, which appear as perturbative corrections for many processes, are formally infinite as the momentum in the loop is integrated over all possible momentums and grows without bound. The solution is a technique referred to as \textit{renormalization}, which deforms the theory in such a way as to keep the solutions finite. Several renormalization schemes-- which all give the same results-- exist, and they can all be thought of as setting some scale which cuts off the infinite integrals in the loops, or which absorb the ``bad,'' un-physical, infinite part of an integral and leave a physical result. The loops then become finite corrections to various properties of the theory-- masses, coupling constants, etc.-- accurate to some order of the perturbative expansion.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{loop.png}
\label{fig:sm:loop}
\caption{An example of a loop, whose contribution to a matrix element is formally infinite, in a QFT calculation.}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

One particularly interesting set of corrections is for the coupling constant, $g_s$ for the strong force\footnote{$g$ and $g'$ for the electroweak force also receive such a correction, but for reasons that will be explained, this correction is not as important for the electroweak force.} The correction to the coupling constant is parameterized by the $\beta$-function, which is used as a part of the \textit{renormalization group equation} to characterize the evolution of the coupling as a function of the $\mu/\Lambda$, or the energy scale over some reference scale of the theory. A positive value of the $\beta$-function implies that the strength of the coupling grows with energy-- this is the direction of the evolution of the electroweak couplings, for instance\footnote{In particular, the $\beta$-function is the coefficient of a $\ln{\mu/\Lambda}$ term in the RGE equation which determines the strength of the coupling constant $g$. So the sign of the $\beta$-function determines whether the RGE is a growing or shrinking exponential, to first order.}. The $\beta$-function for QCD, on the other hand, is:
%
\begin{equation}
\beta(\alpha_s) = - \frac{\alpha_s^2}{2\pi} \left(\frac{11}{3} n_\mathrm{colors} - \frac{4}{3}n_\mathrm{flavors}\right)
\end{equation} 
%
where $\alpha_s = g_s^2 / 4\pi$. The terms here arise from a particularly long calculation (see \cite{schwartz}), but can be understood to arise from gluonic self-interactions for the first term and $q-\bar{q}$ loops for the second term. Since in the SM QCD $n_\mathrm{colors} = 3$ and $n_\mathrm{flavors} = 3$, this combined quantity is negative: the strength of QCD shrinks as the energy scale increases. This phenomena is referred to as \textit{asymptotic freedom}: as the energy scale $\mu$ approaches infinity, the strength of the force drops to zero. Conversely, at low energies, the coupling constant approaches infinity-- meaning that the perturbative expansion used to derive this breaks down, and a new approach must be taken. 

\subsection{Confinement}
\label{chapter:sm:qcd:confinement}

The non-perturbative evolution of $g_s$ at low $\mu$ suggests that a transition occurs in the theory: in fact, this is the process of \textit{color confinement}. Confinement means that objects which are charged under the strong force-- quarks and gluons-- will form bound states with neutral color, such that color is never observed directly. Free quarks and gluons, produced in collisions or decays of other particles, will use some of their energy to create partners to form neutral combinations. This process is also referred to as \textit{hadronization}, in that it is the transition of the partons of QCD into the stable (or semi-stable) hadrons (either mesons, composed of two quarks, or baryons, composed of three quarks) which are observable in experiment. 

This process has an incredible impact on the experimental accessibility of strongly interacting particles: in particular, it means that such particles are never directly observable, but will only ever be seen through the shadow of the hadrons they created. Combined with the \textit{parton shower}-- the radiative process of gluons splitting to quarks and each of these emitting gluon radiation-- this creates the observed phenomena of \textit{jets}: the collimated sprays of measurable particles which correspond to some initial colored particle. Chapter~\ref{chapter:jets-and-substructure} discusses many of the theoretical issues in dealing with jets, and recent advances in the theoretical understanding of these objects; Chapter~\ref{chapter:jet-reconstruction} addresses the experimental issues associated with measuring and reconstructing them.


Finally, it should be noted that the details of confinement are still very mysterious: there is no known mechanism for the transition to this state, and no rigorous proof even that the dynamics of QCD at low $\mu$~should generate bound states. Regardless, there is a great deal of experimental evidence which confirms the evolution of $\alpha_s$ with energy, and the existence of jets and lack-of-observation of colored particles strongly suggest that confinement is very much real. As with any process in physics, understanding becomes much more difficult when a process becomes non-perturbative.

\subsection{Parton Distribution Functions}

At a hadron collider such as the LHC, confinement plays an interesting role in determining not only the outgoing particles-- in the form of jets-- but also the incoming particles, through a process described by \textit{parton distribution functions} (PDFs). The protons which the LHC accelerates are not in fact fundamental objects: they are composed of two up quarks one one down quark, and the gluons which hold them together. This means collisions at the LHC are not really between protons, but between the partons \textit{inside} the protons. Thus, calculations of cross-sections at hadron colliders are not done at a particular energy, or even with specific parton inputs, but instead must be averaged over a distribution of possible input particles and energies those particles might have.

To make matters even more interesting, the deep structure of the proton is much more complicated than a simple view of $uud$ would suggest. The internal gluons holding the hadron together can split into virtual quark/anti-quark pairs before reforming to gluons: these virtual quarks, referred to as \textit{sea} partons (as opposed to the \textit{valence} partons $uud$), as well as the gluons inside the proton, can also participate in collisions.

Thankfully, the situation is not completely hopeless: the QCD factorization theorem states that the cross-section of a hard-scattering (i.e., the $2\ra2$ or $2\ra n$ prcoess describing the actual collision) can be factorized from the non-perturbative structure of the hadrons causing the collision. The probability of a particular parton from the proton interacting at some momentum-scale $Q^2$ with some energy fraction $x$ from the proton is parameterized by the PDF's previously mentioned. An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sm:pdf}: at low energy, or low $Q^2$, the $u$ and $d$ quark (as well as the gluon) are dominant, but at higher $Q^2$ it is possible for even sea $c$ and $b$ quarks to participate in interactions. Many different parameterizations of PDFs are available, each using a variety of measurements and theories to constrain the provided functions \editnote{cite}.

% The process of confinement, and its relationship with asymptotic freedom, can be understood better in certain limits. For example, consider a pair of quarks in a bound state. At very high $\mu$-- that is, very small distance scales-- the particles are free to move without restriction, as the ``rubber band'' that is holding them together has not been stretched. As we transition to lower e


\section{Matter}
\label{chapter:sm:matter}

The gauge bosons of the fundamental symmetry groups of the SM are commonly referred to as force-carriers, as they mediate the interactions of their respective sectors. Another class of particles, called \textit{matter}, is not responsible for the mediation of forces. Unlike the force-carriers, which are all which are all bosons and have integer spin, matter particles are all fermions and have half-integer spin. Matter in the SM is composed of 3 generations each of the previously mentioned quarks, and another family of fermions referred to as leptons which do not carry color charge. Each generation consists of a pair of related particles; each generation is identical except for the masses of the particles. Each fermion also has an anti-particle partner, which is alike in all ways except for having the opposite charges.

\subsection{Quarks}

Quarks, as already described, are the constituent particles of protons, neutrons, and the remainder of the hadron zoo. They are charged under the $SU(3)_C$ of the strong force, so they interact with the strong force via gluons; they are also charged under $SU(2)_W \otimes U(1)_Y$, so they also interact with the $W$, $Z$, and $\gamma$ of the electroweak force. The various types of quarks, paired into generation columns, are:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:quarks}
\colvec{2}{u}{d},  \colvec{2}{c}{s},  \colvec{2}{t}{b}
\end{equation}
%
and are commonly referred to as the up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom flavors. The top row is commonly referred to as ``up''-type, and all have electric charge of $+2/3$; the bottom row is referred to as ``down''-type and has electric charge of $-1/3$. The lightest generation is listed on the left, and the heaviest on the right. The $u$ are $d$ nearly degenerate in mass, with masses of $2.3$ and $4.8$ MeV respectively, while the $s$ is not much heavier at $95$ MeV: for the purposes of many applications in high-energy experiments, these are all effectively massless. The remaining quarks, however, are much heavier: the $c$ has a mass of $1.3$ GeV, and the $b$ has $4.2$ GeV. The top is even more massive, at $173$ GeV: approximately the same mass as an atom of gold. This mass is so high that the top quark, unlike the others, decays before it has the time to hadronize, and no top-quark bound states exist. These masses are free parameters of the theory, and arise via a mechanism described in Section~\ref{chapter:sm:matter:masses}-- while there is no expectation that they be identical, there is also no explanation for them having such different properties.

\subsection{Leptons}

Leptons are the second category of matter-- they all interact via the weak force, and none are charged under the strong force. Once again, they have three generations organized into pairs:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:leptons}
\colvec{2}{\nu_e}{e},  \colvec{2}{\nu_\mu}{\mu},  \colvec{2}{\nu_\tau}{\tau}
\end{equation}
%
The bottom row, referred to as the ``charged leptons'', all have charge $-1$, and have mass in increasing order of the generation. They are called the electron, muon, and tau, respectively. The electron is completely stable, while the muon has a lifetime on the order of $10^{-6}$~s, and therefore is stable as far as high-energy experiments are concerned. The $\tau$ has a much shorter lifetime, and can decay into the other leptons or in hadronic channel, making the identification of $\tau$'s much more challenging at the LHC than the other leptons. For this reason, ``leptonic'' analyses at the LHC often refer to analyses involving the first two generations only.

The top row of Equation~\ref{eqn:leptons} is referred to as neutrinos: these particles, as the name suggests, are electrically neutral and therefore do not interact with the photon. Almost all particle detection mechanisms at the LHC (see Chapter~\ref{chapter:detector}) rely on the particle interacting with the detector electromagnetically, and so for this reason, neutrinos are not directly observed in collision events. Instead, their presence is inferred from mis-balances in momentum and energy conservation (in the transverse plane). Neutrinos are also effectively massless: while observations over the past 20 years \editnote{cite} have confirmed that they do have masses, they are so vanishingly small that they have little experimental consequence at the LHC.

\subsection{Interactions}

The matter particles described now are all written in the Dirac representation, which combines $L$ and $R$ chiralities into a single spinor object.  Above the electroweak breaking scale, it is also possible to write them as $SU(2)$ doublet pairs (paired following the column structure of Equations~\ref{eqn:quarks} and \ref{eqn:leptons}): these are referred to as $Q^i$ and $L^i$ respectively, and contain the left-handed fields only. The right handed fields are uncharged under the weak interaction, and therefore form the $SU(2)$ singlets $e_R^i$, $\nu_R^i$, $u_R^i$ and $d_R^i$\footnote{Technically, the right-handed $\nu_R^i$ have not been observed, as only the neutrinos which interact via the weak force have been measured.}

Since the $Q$ and $L$ doublets interact via the weak force, interaction terms for them look like:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:weak-interactions}
\mL_\mathrm{interactions} = i \bar{L}_i (\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - i g \gamma^\mu W_\mu^a \tau^a - i' Y_L \gamma^\mu B_\mu) L_i
\end{equation}
%
with a similar term for $Q$; the singlets interact only with the hypercharge boson, $B$. The off-diagonal terms of the $W\tau$ term (which contain the $W_1$ and $W_2$ terms) couple together the top and bottom rows of the $SU(2)$ doublets. Once everything is re-written in the mass eigenstates once the electroweak symmetry is broken, this means that the $W^\pm$ bosons (the linear combinations of $W_1$ and $W_2$) exchange an up-type quark for a down-type quark or vice versa (and likewise exchange charged-leptons for neutrinos). The structure of the weak interaction thus has very interesting consequences for how matter interacts with it.

\subsection{Masses}
\label{chapter:sm:matter:masses}

Just as for the gauge bosons, mass terms for fermions are problematic: a Dirac mass term like $m \bar{\psi} \psi = m\bar{\psi}_L \psi_R + m \bar{\psi}_L \psi_R$ is not invariant under the $SU(2)$ group, as the $SU(2)$ transformation affects only the left-handed component. The solution is to couple the the matter terms to the Higgs boson via a Yukawa coupling:
%
\begin{equation}
\mL_\mathrm{Yukawa} = - y \bar{Q} H d_R + h.c.
\end{equation}
%
The $Q$ and $H$ transform with an opposite phase under an $SU(2)$ transformation, and thus maintain gauage invariance. After symmetry breaking this generates a mass term of the form $-m_d(\bar{d}_L d_R + \bar{d}_R d_L)$--- recall that we choose $\colvec{2}{0}{v}$ as the direction of the Higgs field, so only the down-type quarks gets a mass from this--- where $m_d = \frac{y}{\sqrt{2}}v$. The up-type quarks get a mass from a similar term, using $\bar{Q}\sigma_2 H^*$ to rotate the vev into the up-type sector while preserving gauge invariance. Thus, mass originates not as a fundamental property of a particle, but from the interaction of the particle with the Higgs field. Different masses are possible as a consequence of different Yukawa couplings for each particle.

In order to provide for the masses of multiple generations of quarks, a more complicated Yukawa structure using matrices (indexing the flavor via $i,j$) is required:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:yukawa_masses}
\mL_\mathrm{mass} = -Y_{ij}^d \bar{Q}^i H d_R^j - i Y_{ij}^d \sigma_2 H^* u_R^j + h.c.
\end{equation}
%
After symmetry breaking, this reduces to:
%
\begin{equation}
\mL_\mathrm{mass} = - \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} (\bar{d}_L Y_d d_R + \bar{u}_L Y_u uR) + h.c.
\end{equation}
%
These Yukawa matrices are arbitrary, and are in general not diagonal: this means that once we diagonalize the matrix to the mass eigenbasis:
%
\begin{equation}
\mL_\mathrm{mass} = - m_j^d \bar{d}^j_L d^j_R - m_j^u \bar{u}_L^j u^j_R + h.c.,
\end{equation}
%
this is \textit{not} the same as the original $SU(2)$ interaction basis written down in Equation~\ref{eqn:quarks}. In fact, if we transform the interactions of Equation~\ref{eqn:weak-interactions} with the diagonalization matrix used to change these bases, we will see that most terms transform cleanly, but terms which mix $u_L$ and $d_L$ will not remain diagonal in the flavor-basis. The particles we are familiar with exist in the mass eigenstate, and so it is most common to adopt that basis and introduce off-diagonal terms into the interactions. This means, for example, that while the $W$ usually decays to $ud$ or $cs$, it can also decay to $us$ or $cd$. The exact level of non-diagonalization is parameterized by the \textit{CKM matrix}: most terms are very close to on-diagonal, but the rate of decays for the $W$ to $us$ and $cd$ are approximately $4\%$.

Note that because the charged-leptons correspond to the ``down''-type, and the neutrinos are massless\footnote{At least, their masses seem to most likely be acquired via a different mechanism, not described here.}, the second term of Equation~\ref{eqn:yukawa_masses} is not necessary in the lepton-mass sector. Therefore there is no problem in diagonalizing the mass-basis and interaction-basis simultaneously, there is no CKM matrix for the lepton sector.

\section{Summary}

The particle content of the Standard Model is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:sm:summary}: the Higgs boson sits at the heart of the theory, the 4 gauge bosons interact with matter and transmit the forces, and the 12 matter particles form the atoms which we are all composed of. It is a remarkably concise theory: simply the statement of three generations of matter, the $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge symmetry, the non-trivial minimum of the Higgs-potential, and Lorentz invariance gets us remarkably far in uniquely determining the shape of the theory. It took decades of theoretical insight and experimental work to create such a powerful description of the Universe, but the resilience of SM predictions to even very high energies proves the soundness of the underlying theory.
