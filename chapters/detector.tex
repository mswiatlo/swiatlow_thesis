The design of the LHC, with two high-luminosity interaction points at opposite ends of the ring, called for two general purpose detectors to be built in these locations. Their charge was to accurately reconstruct collision events in the most hostile conditions yet seen in a collider: with a bunch spacing of 25 ns and the unprecedented introduction of pile-up the detectors would have an enormous challenge ahead of them. ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC APparatus)~\cite{ATLASPaper} and CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid)~\cite{CMSPaper} were the two detectors built for this task, with ATLAS occupying the (much more convenient) Point 1 and CMS located at the (very distant) Point 5.

In keeping with the principle of ``similar, but opposite'' established by their locations, the ATLAS and CMS detectors take

\section{History}

The first public discussion of the proposals which became the ATLAS detector occurred in 1992 at the General Meeting on LHC Physics at Evian-les-Bains~\cite{Evian,EvianCourier}. At the time, four general purpose detectors (much like the four detector configuration in place at LEP) were seriously considered: EAGLE, ASCOT, CMS, and L3 (as an upgrade to the existing LEP detector, including a movable stage which would allow it to take data from both $e^+/e^-$ and $pp$ collisions). Several additional single purpose (heavy ion, neutrino, and $B$-physics) detectors were also proposed.

ATLAS emerged in a later 1992 Letter of Intent as a merger of the ASCOT and EAGLE collaborations~\cite{ATLAS-LoI}. ASCOT (Apparatus with SuperCOnducting Toroids) contributed the physically-defining feature of the secondary toroidal magnet system and standalone muon measurement system, as well as the tradition of using a tortured amalgamation of letters to form a name. EAGLE (Experiment for Accurate Gamma, Lepton and Energy measurements) on the other hand featured a stronger 2 T magnetic field, and inner-detector and calorimeter designs more similar to some of the final ATLAS systems. The detector described in the Letter of Intent already resembled ATLAS in many important ways, featuring the superconducting air-core toroids, accordion-shaped liquid Argon electromagnetic calorimeters, scintillating tile hadron calorimeters, and multi-design inner detector. \ref{fig:detector:earlyatlas} shows an early drawing of ATLAS from the Letter, and already the detector looks recognizable to its current form.
