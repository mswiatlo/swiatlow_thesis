	Abstract = {The ATLAS detector has been designed for operation at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. ATLAS includes electromagnetic and hadronic liquid argon calorimeters, with almost 200,000 channels of data that must be sampled at the LHC bunch crossing frequency of 40 MHz. The calorimeter electronics calibration and readout are performed by custom electronics developed specifically for these purposes. This paper describes the system performance of the ATLAS liquid argon calibration and readout electronics, including noise, energy and time resolution, and long term stability, with data taken mainly from full-system calibration runs performed after installation of the system in the ATLAS detector hall at CERN.},

@article{SCTPaper,
	Abstract = {The semiconductor tracker is a silicon microstrip detector forming part of the inner tracking system of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The operation and performance of the semiconductor tracker during the first years of LHC running are described. More than 99% of the detector modules were operational during this period, with an average intrinsic hit efficiency of (99.74{\^A}$\pm$0.04)%. The evolution of the noise occupancy is discussed, and measurements of the Lorentz angle, {\^I}{\v Z}-ray production and energy loss presented. The alignment of the detector is found to be stable at the few-micron level over long periods of time. Radiation damage measurements, which include the evolution of detector leakage currents, are found to be consistent with predictions and are used in the verification of radiation background simulations.},

@article{Combinatorics,
	Abstract = {In 2011 the LHC provided excellent data, the integrated luminosity of about 5 fb {\^a}1 was more than what was expected. The price for this huge data set is the in- and out-of-time pileup, additional soft collisions overlaid on top of the interesting collision. The reconstruction software is very sensitive to these additional particles in the event, as the reconstruction time increases due to increased combinatorics. During the running of the experiment in 2011, several successful changes to the software were made that sped up the reconstruction. Pileup has different effects on the various detector technologies used in ATLAS and a general recipe for all subdetectors is not applicable.},
